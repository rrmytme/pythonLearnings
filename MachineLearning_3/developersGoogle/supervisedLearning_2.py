Supervised machine learning is based on the following core concepts:

Data - Data is the driving force of ML. Data comes in the form of words and numbers stored in tables, or as the values of pixels and waveforms captured in images and audio files. 
We store related data in datasets. For example - Housing prices, Images of cats, Weather information.
Data = Features + Label or just Features (ere Features are input parameters and Labels are predicted values)

Dataset - A dataset is characterized by its size and diversity. Size indicates the number of examples. Diversity indicates the range those examples cover. Good datasets are both large and highly diverse.

Model - a model is the complex collection of numbers that define the mathematical relationship from specific input feature patterns to specific output label values. The model discovers these patterns through training.

Training - To train a model, we give the model a dataset with labeled examples. The model's goal is to work out the best solution for predicting the labels from the features. The model finds the best solution by comparing its predicted value to the label's actual value. Based on the difference between the predicted and actual values—defined as the loss—the model gradually updates its solution. In other words, the model learns the mathematical relationship between the features and the label so that it can make the best predictions on unseen data.

Evaluating - evaluate te model's prediction vs Actual and improve the model if requires.

Inference - Satisfied model can use for predictions is called as Inference
