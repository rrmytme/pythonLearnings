ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content from data. 

A model is a mathematical relationship derived from data that an ML system uses to make predictions 

Types:

Supervised learning - Supervised learning models can make predictions after seeing lots of data with the correct answers and then discovering the connections between the elements in the data that produce the correct answers
Unsupervised learning - models make predictions by being given data that does not contain any correct answers. An unsupervised learning model's goal is to identify meaningful patterns among the data. In other words, the model has no hints on how to categorize each piece of data, but instead it must infer its own rules.
Reinforcement learning - models make predictions by getting rewards or penalties based on actions performed within an environment. A reinforcement learning system generates a policy that defines the best strategy for getting the most rewards.
Generative AI - is a class of models that creates content from user input. For example, generative AI can create unique images, music compositions, and jokes; it can summarize articles, explain how to perform a task, or edit a photo.

Supervised learning: 
Regression - predicts a numeric value. For example, a weather model that predicts the amount of rain, in inches or millimeters
Classification - predict the likelihood that something belongs to a category For example, classification models are used to predict if an email is spam or if a photo contains a cat.
Binary classification (1 out of 2) ex: Rain or No Rain, Multiclass classification (1 out of many) Ex: Rain or Snow or hail or sleet. 

Unsupervised learning: 
A commonly used unsupervised learning model employs a technique called clustering. The model finds data points that demarcate natural groupings.
For example, an unsupervised model might cluster a weather dataset based on temperature, revealing segmentations that define the seasons. You might then attempt to name those clusters based on your understanding of the dataset.

Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning is used to train robots to perform tasks, like walking around a room, and software programs like AlphaGo to play the game of Go.
